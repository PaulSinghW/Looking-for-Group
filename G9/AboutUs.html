				Alex was born in Maple Ditch, British Columbia. The smell of manure and meth labs inspired him to leave the small town of his birth and
				travel the world. After years of being under-employed as a Philosophy graduate he decided to come to BCIT to train for a real job that didn't
				involve teaching small, snotty, germ-ridden children. 
                <br>
				<br>
                Alex has always been a gamer and he is excited to share his passion with the world. An integral part of our team at LFG Alex is the director
				of the board games section. He can be reached at someone@example.com.

                Dasha was born in Moscow, Russia in 1812 during the height of the Cold War. She was born into a family
                of 14 children and a single mother. She liked to spend her childhood running barefoot in mud and making 
                flower chains for their pet goat. He always had at least two chainz. 
                <br>
				<br>
                Fast forward to her 18th birthday, she is now in the CST program at BCIT. She's having lots of fun learning
                how to program in Java and how to make functional, responsive websites. She's made lots of friends on the way
                and she can't wait to learn more!

Misha has grown up in Surrey his whole life, ever since his family moved
from Ontario to British Columbia on his sixth birthday. His family was one 
of board game lovers so it wasn't a suprise when that love of playing games
extended to video games when he got his own computer at the age of 12. Just
playing on the computer wasn't enough so Misha signed up for a summer camp 
that taught him about building and upgrading personal computers that same summer.
Traditionally an RPG player, misha now enjoys real time strategy games and 
Magic the Gathering with his friends as well.
<br>
<br>
Today, Misha still lives in Surrey along with his best friend and their two dog's.
His love of computers brought him to BCIT to study in the CST program full time with
hopes of one day becoming a sysadmin after graduation. In his spare time he enjoy's
food with excessive cheese and going for drives on sunny days.
