		<h3> Summary </h3>
		<p> Riot has just reworked Galio and things are looking great for him.</p>
		<p>Orianna's latest rework is pushing her solo queue winrates higher and Irelia is making some progress in top lane.</p>
		<p> The PICK OR BAN champs for this patch: </p>
		<p> GOD TIER</P>
 <p>
	For the midlane, Ahri, Talon, and Orianna are your go to picks. These champs are versatile and must haves.
</P>
 <p>
	For the toplane, Kled, Fiora, and Pantheon. Kled and Pantheon constantly pressure the map with their ultimates.
</P>
<p> The rest of the roles right now are leaning towards more mobility. </P>

<p> This makes Lucian the number one go to adc for all elos </p>
		
		<h1> League of Legends Patch Notes 7.7 </h1>
		<h3> Summary </h3>
		<p> Riot is focusing on buffing or adding new complexities to older champions like amumu and nunu.</p>
		<p>This is a step forward onto making the older champions just as competitive as the newer ones.</p>
		<p> The official note from riot: </p>
		<p> Salutations! </P>
 <p>
Welcome to the patch 7.7 notefull list ofs, the one where we’ve got changes to a lot of different stuff - forgotten supports and weak junglers for starters. Also, the header art’s different, so that’s neat. (We found a folder of cool pictures from seasons past, so we’re gonna start rotating through ‘em patch by patch!)

In terms of highlights, we've made chime collecting more rewarding for Bard and given Amumu better tools to help his teammates. Maybe now they’ll stick around after the match and be friends. We also have some quality of life buffs to some junglers that aren't so popular right now, such as Volibear and Jarvan IV. Plus, given the MSI hype engine is warming up, we’re taking another pass at the competitive scene (the faces will be pretty familiar).

In terms of a different kind of Highlight, the updated client’s got some improvements to the Highlights viewing experience (spoiler: you no longer have to root around in your file explorer). Those details, plus the rest of our client updates, can be found further down in the patch notes as usual.

That's it for this patch! Buckle up and dive into the buffet of changes below. See you on the Rift!</p>
		<br><p> Here are some recommendations on champs to look out for below: </p><br>
		<p> Buffs: Amumu, Alistar, Bard, Jarvan IV, Jinx, Kassadin, Lux, Nunu, Volibear </p>
		<p> Nerfs: Camille, Galio, Graves, Katarina, Rengar, Rumble, Shaco, Talon </p> <br>

			Microsoft has released the tech specs for their upcoming console, Project Scorpio, that they report will be 4.6 times more powerful

			Microsoft reports that this console will be able to run Xbox One games at 4K with 60fps. The release date is projected to be in about 6 months,
			at an estimated cost of $500 USD. Microsoft says that this will be the most powerful console in the world currently, and we wait anxiously to see 
			if that's true.
