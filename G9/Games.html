			<h2>Massive Multiplayer Online Role Playing Games</h2>
			</p>
		<div>
			MMORPG's can best be descibed as interactive Dungeons and Dragons games. At the core of every MMORPG is a large explorable world
			for players to roam oftentimes accompanied by deep, integrated lore and backstories for the world the developers built. Upon creating 
			an avatar to represent themselves in the world, players choose a "class" for their avatar, with each class having different unique 
			abilities available to them to use.
			<br>
			<br>
			There is never a set "goal" in MMORPG's, rather, the goal is to make connections with other players to accomplish feats within the virtual
			world. Developers program dungeons for players to explore together, which oftentimes contain boss monsters that require a group of players
			to take down. In order to get stronger, players will find magical armaments, weapons and armor, which when equipped help increase their
			avatars strengths and cover up their weakness's.
			<br>
			<br>
			If going on an adventure with friends in a wide open world is something that sounds exciting to you, you might want to give MMORPG's a try.

			<h2>Massive Multiplayer Online Battle Arena's</h2>
			</p>
  	    <div>
		MOBA's are best likened to this centuries interactive tower defense games. Traditionally, MOBA's are played by two teams of five on a small map
		that contains a base for each team with the objective being to destroy your opponents base. Each base has a set number of pathways leading 
		out of it with each pathway containing "towers" that the oposing team must destroy in order to get into your base. Each player selects a character
		to play out of a pre-defined roster of characters, each one having different abilities. Each player will then work with his teammates to take down
		the other team's characters, destroy their towers and eventually the base.
		<br>
		<br>
		These games have become increasingly popular, due in no small part to the fact that they often have low system requirements and do not require all that
		much time to play. Each game lasts anywhere from 20 to 45 minutes on average, which is nice if you want to sit down after a long day to play with friends
		but don't have much time for a longer time sink. Another key advantage to playing MOBA's is that each time you start a new game, everyones characters start
		on the same level. This means that it doesn't matter if someone sinks more time into the game than you, as long as your raw skill is better than theirs
		you will come out on top.
		<br>
		<br>
		If playing short, competitive games with friends is something that excites you, this genre is definetly something you should try out.

			<h2>First Person Shooters</h2>
			</p>
			<div>
			FPS's or first person shooters are fast paced, action packed games traditionally played on teams of five to ten players. There are different
			game modes in every game, with capture the flag, deathmatch, king of the hill and bombing missions being some of the more popular ones. Players
			join a team and use gun based combat to fight the opposing team, often augmenting their charcters each round with different weapons and explosives.
			There is usually a playstyle for everyone with sniper's being available for the more tactical soldier, machine guns for the gutsy and traditional assault
			rifles and sub machine guns for a more traditional touch. 
			<br>
			<br>
			First person shooters were more often than not always based on non fictional standards, but for those who enjoy a more fantasy setting games like Halo
			and Blizzard Entertainments new Overwatch might do the trick. These games retain all of the well known standards of the FPS environment but at the same
			time add in a splash of sci-fi. Overwatch made waves as one of the first first person shooters in the market to successfully implement a class system
			into their game; each player can choose a specific character to play as each round and each one of those characters has different unique abilities to use.
			<br>
			<br>
			If you enjoy super fast, action packed mini rounds of gameplay with a strategic edge, you should give first person shooters a try.

			<h2>Board Games</h2>
			</p>
			<div>
			Board games are some of the earliest renditions of multiplayer games known to man kind. We all know what they are; most of us grew up playing games such
			as monopoly or scrabble but of recent years the table top genre has expanded into even more complex and intricate designs. Board games are played with three 
			or more people with games often spanning over an hour in most cases. There are different types of board games from games where the objective is to beat all other
			players in achieving a goal, to working together with others to complete a task. 
			<br>
			<br>
			There are even card games, such as magic the gathering, pokemon or yu-gi-oh for those that want a collectors spin on board games. In each of these games, players
			collect different cards that have a different role in how the game is played out. They construct decks of these cards, then play against an opponent who has 
			constructed their own deck. Following common rules pertaining to whichever game they are both playing, players take turns back and forth until one of them meets
			the criteria for a win.
			<br>
			<br>
			If you enjoy being face to face with friends spending time together, you should dead down to your local hobby shop and pick up some board games.
